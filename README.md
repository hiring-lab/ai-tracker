# Indeed AI Tracker

This repository contains the data behind the *Indeed Hiring Lab's* AI Tracker data product. The frequency of the data is daily and it is refreshed each month.

## Methodology

The data in this repository are the share of AI (and generative AI) job postings, as a percentage of overall job postings, using a seven-day trailing average. We calculate the aggregate share of job postings in a specific location that included keywords associated specifically with:

-   AI (e.g. "Machine Learning", "Data Science" and "Artificial Intelligence")
-   Generative AI (e.g. "Generative AI", "Large Language Models" and "Chat GPT")

We currently cover the following countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, UK, Ireland, Singapore, US.
